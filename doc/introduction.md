BraillePad - transmitting handy chords into characters
------------------------------------------------------

BraillePad is a chording keyboard add-on that fits on the back side of a mobile phone, enabling ergonomic text entry from an arbitrary body position, without the need for changing your finger placement. BraillePad can be used to input any of the ASCII characters while preserving the normal functionality of your smartphone or other mobile device.

BraillePad eliminates the need to look at your on-screen keyboard, which makes it a good assistive device for someone with poor eyesight. A further advantage is that it builds on the standard Braille typing system.

Example of an iPhone app that uses the touchscreen for Braille input: http://youtu.be/xlwRxzljt7gil . In comparison, BraillePad will offer an ergonomic grip, the feel of buttons, feedback from the device screen and the possibility to use the screen for gestures.

For a normal-sighted user, however, the innovative design eliminates the need for an on-screen keyboard, thus increasing valuable screen space. The combined benefit is a complete ergonomic computer input solution for wirelessly controlling the keyboard (using BraillePad) and mouse (utilizing the touchscreen as a touchpad).

BraillePad expands the possibilities for interacting with devices, for example by binding the physical key combinations to act as arrows and action buttons to act as a game controller for retro game console emulator software.

The first proof-of-concept prototype with standard USB connectivity was made during TechnoHack (24.-26. Oct. 2014). During the Garage48 weekend we plan to find out user needs, collect valuable user feedback, find the best design solutions for the multitude of applications, create blueprints for the second prototype, look for partnerships, elaborate on the sequence of developments and discuss market entry point and our business model.
