BraillePad - transmitting handy chords into characters
------------------------------------------------------

BraillePad is a chording keyboard add-on that fits on the back side of a
mobile phone, enabling ergonomic text entry without changing finger
placement. BraillePad can be used to input any of the ASCII
characters while preserving the normal functionality of your smartphone
or other mobile device.

BraillePad will also enable you to write from an arbitrary position and without
the need to look at your keyboard. This makes it a good assistive device for
the visually impaired, a futher advantage is that it builds on the standard
Braille typing system.

Example of iPhone app that uses the touchscreen for Braille input:

software solution is poor ergonomics.

For the sighted user, the innovative design eliminates the need for an
on-screen keyboard, thus increasing valuable screen space. The
combined benefit for a sighted user is to have a complete and portable
ergonomic UI to be used with any external device.
BraillePad opens novel and attractive ways of interacting with technology such as
binding arrow and action keys to the buttons, turning the phone into a
game controller to be used with game console emulator software.

The first proof-of-concept prototype with standard USB connectivity
was made during TechnoHack (24.-26. Oct. 2014). During the Garage48
weekend we plan to conduct user-experiments and need finding, find the
best design solutions for the multitude of applications, create blueprints
for the second prototype, look for partnerships, elaborate on the sequence
of developments and discuss market entry point and our buisess model.
